- In the ever-evolving landscape of healthcare, the integration of advanced technologies has become imperative to enhance accessibility and efficiency. 
- Our proposed methodology addresses this need through a two-fold approach, combining a fine-tuned LLaMA2 model using the QLoRa technique with a comprehensive database of doctors.
- By leveraging publicly available datasets, encompassing biomedical, patient-physician dialogues, and mental health conversations, we aim to empower users with a conversational assistant capable of delivering real-time and accurate health assistance.
